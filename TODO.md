- Check the reward contract fixes are ok
- Reward epoch choice, what is the random
  - if a random is revealed by everybody
- Make integration with WNat contract, for claims
- Snapshoting weights for reward epoch, truncating
  - truncated weight used to compete for rewards
- Integration with the existing VoterWhitelister and adaptation of the reward manager to use with WNat contract on Coston/2. Possibly truncating vote power?
- If a claim with amount for some price epoch yields no rewards (no rewarded weight), there should be produced a back claim for the offer issuer. Each offer should contain offer issuer address, so that the funds can be returned (RewardCalculatorForPriceEpoch.ts:L125)
- Code should be commented better. Maybe a bit refactored for easier use.
- Web3 library provider should be implemented and FTSO client enabled for real time use. Needed for deployment on Coston. Implement scheduling of jobs. Add configurations.
- Real price feeds integration must be done. Use FTSO provider by Flare. Implement plugable price feeds.
- Deployment code scripts
- Docs folder. Mirror the documentation from google docs to the repo.

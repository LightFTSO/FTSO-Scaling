- Check the reward contract fixes are ok
- Offer rewards should emit events. Events should be indexed on a client as a proof of a successful reward offer. Offers should not be extracted from function calldata, as a function may revert. The Offer event should have address of the issuer as well.
- If a claim with amount for some price epoch yields no rewards (no rewarded weight), there should be produced a back claim for the offer issuer. Each offer should contain offer issuer address, so that the funds can be returned (RewardCalculatorForPriceEpoch.ts:L125)
- Lead data providers and their limitation on the reward should be considered when reward is calculated.
- Code should be commented better. Maybe a bit refactored for easier use.
- Web3 library provider should be implemented and FTSO client enabled for real time use. Needed for deployment on Coston. Implement scheduling of jobs. Add configurations.
- Real price feeds integration must be done. Use FTSO provider by Flare. Implement plugable price feeds.
- Deployment code scripts
- Docs folder. Mirror the documentation from google docs to the repo.
- Integration with the existing VoterWhitelister and adaptation of the reward manager to use with WNat contract on Coston/2
- IQR and PCT share may change. How to handle this.
- Elastic band should be per currency per price epoch
